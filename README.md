## Overview

TEMPO looks at how brain structure, cognition and everyday functioning **change over time** in people with **mild cognitive impairment (MCI)** compared with **cognitively normal (CN)** individuals. Using longitudinal data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), it estimates rates of change over **12-month** and **18-month** observation windows and tests which features worsen faster in MCI.

## Objective

To identify MRI, cognitive and functional features that show greater longitudinal worsening in individuals with MCI than in CN individuals over 12- and 18-month observation windows.

## Background

Describing the multimodal changes that separate CN and MCI groups may improve understanding of the longitudinal patterns associated with early neurodegenerative change.

## Design / Methods

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| **Data source** | Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), ADNIMERGE / ADNIMERGE2 |
| **Imaging** | 3-T MRI processed with the FreeSurfer longitudinal pipeline (UCSF FreeSurfer 5.1, `UCSFFSL51`) |
| **Groups** | Baseline CN vs baseline MCI. Excluded: baseline dementia, MCI→CN reverters and converters within the observation window |
| **Windows** | 12 months and 18 months of follow-up (≥ 2 scans per participant) |
| **Statistical model** | Linear mixed-effects models (`lme4` / `lmerTest`): `outcome ~ time_years * BL_DIAGNOSIS + (1 + time_years | RID)`. These handle repeated measures within individuals and unequal follow-up |
| **MRI rate of change** | Annual percentage change (APC) relative to diagnosis-specific baseline means; volumes normalised to intracranial volume (ICV) |
| **Between-group test** | Time × diagnosis interaction, with Benjamini–Hochberg FDR correction within each window |

**18 MRI features** (bilateral regions averaged):

- **Ventricular (3):** lateral ventricles, inferior lateral ventricles, third ventricle
- **Cortical (6):** entorhinal, fusiform, middle temporal, precuneus, insula, lateral occipital
- **Subcortical (7):** hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, putamen, caudate, nucleus accumbens, pallidum
- **Global (2):** total gray matter volume, total cortical volume (cortical GM + cortical WM)

**Cognitive and functional outcomes:**

- ADAS-Cog 13
- ADNI composite scores: memory (ADNI-MEM), executive function (ADNI-EF), language (ADNI-LAN), visuospatial (ADNI-VS)
- Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) for everyday functioning

## Key results

**12-month window**

- MCI showed greater relative volume loss in the **entorhinal cortex (−2.80 %/yr)** and **insula (−1.20 %/yr)**, plus greater ventricular expansion than CN.
- The **insula** was the only region with a significant between-group APC difference after correction: **−1.03 %/yr (95 % CI −1.67 to −0.39; adjusted p = 0.032)**.
- Cognitive and functional rates of decline were similar between groups after correction.

**18-month window**

| Feature | MCI vs CN difference in APC | Adjusted p |
|---|---|---|
| Lateral ventricles | +1.61 %/yr | ≤ 0.032 |
| Fusiform gyrus | −0.90 %/yr | ≤ 0.032 |
| Entorhinal cortex | −1.17 %/yr | ≤ 0.032 |
| Middle temporal gyrus | −0.73 %/yr | ≤ 0.032 |
| Insula | −0.53 %/yr | ≤ 0.032 |

- MCI showed faster decline in **memory (adjusted p = 0.0061)** and **everyday functioning, FAQ (adjusted p = 0.0062)**.

## Conclusions

MCI was associated with greater relative changes in selected ventricular, temporal and limbic structures, with more regional differences detectable over 18 months than over 12 months. Greater memory decline and worsening everyday functioning were also evident in MCI over 18 months. These findings support longitudinal multimodal assessment to characterise the features that distinguish MCI from cognitively normal status.

## How to run

1. **Get ADNI data access.** Apply at [adni.loni.usc.edu](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/), then download the ADNIMERGE tables (including `UCSFFSL51.csv`, `DXSUM.csv`, `ADAS.csv`, `FAQ.csv`, `PTDEMOG.csv`) and the ADNIMERGE2 data.
2. **Set the paths** in `config.R`, or set the environment variables `ADNIMERGE_DIR` and `ADNIMERGE2_DIR`.
3. **Install the packages:**
   ```r
   source("install_packages.R")
   ```
4. **Run the scripts in order** (`01` → `08`) from the project root, in the same R session. Later scripts reuse objects created by earlier ones (for example `master_visit`, `trajectory_cohort`, `lme_12m`, `lme_18m_data`).

> **Note:** These scripts were written as an interactive, step-by-step analysis workflow, with audit and integrity checks kept inline. Run them one after another in a single session rather than as standalone programs.

**Software:** R (≥ 4.2) with tidyverse, data.table, lme4, lmerTest, corrplot, ggrepel, ggseg, patchwork, here.
